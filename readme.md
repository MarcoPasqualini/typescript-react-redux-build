- material-ui to get some basic ui elements;
- testing using karma, written using jasmine/sinon and run using phantomJS;
- automatic test coverage reports;
- generating documentation using typedoc.

A list of all packages installed is [here](trrb-docs/packages.md)

# How to use
- Run the `npm install` command to install all dependencies;
- Run the `npm run postinstall` command to clean some folders related to only this repository

A list of all command is available [here](trrb-docs/commands.md)

# Information
I made this build system to continue my work on another project.
I don't know for how long I will be able to support this code, but I will try to keep it up to date and issue-free for as long as I can.

# Next release
For the next release I hope to be able to add/solve the following features:
- extend this readme and provide information about every warning obtained during installation and other operations.
